NavContainer(navigator) { _, destination ->
    when (destination) {
        "Greeting" -> Text("Hello")
        "Farewell" -> Text("Good-bye")
        else -> Text("Unexpected Key: $key")
    }
}

navigator.goTo("Farewell")
```

### Repository

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url = uri("https://repo.repsy.io/mvn/chrynan/public")
    }
}
```

### Dependencies

#### core

```groovy
implementation("com.chrynan.navigation:navigation-core:VERSION")
```

#### compose

```groovy
implementation("com.chrynan.navigation:navigation-compose:VERSION")
```

### Usage üë®‚Äçüíª

* Create a `Navigator` for any `NavigationDestination` type that you will use as a destination key. This can be Strings,
  enums, sealed classes, or any type.

```kotlin
enum class Destination {

    HOME,
    SETTINGS,
    DETAILS
}

@Composable
fun App() {
    val navigator = rememberNavigator(initialDestination = Destination.HOME)
}
```

* Create a `NavContainer` to display the current content based off of the latest navigation context and destination
  values.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun App() {
    val navigator = rememberNavigator(initialDestination = Destination.HOME)

    NavContainer(navigator = navigator) { _, destination ->
        when (destination) {
            Destination.HOME -> HomeScreenComposable()
            Destination.SETTINGS -> SettingsScreenComposable()
            Destination.DETAILS -> DetailsScreenComposable()
        }
    }
}
```

* Use the `Navigator` instance to navigate between navigation contexts and destinations.

```kotlin
BackHandler { navigator.goBack() }
```

#### Navigation Contexts

Complex navigation flows require multiple stacks of navigation destinations that may be retained when changing stacks.
These stacks are referred to as `NavigationContext` in this library. A `NavigationContext` is an interface that defines
the default navigation destination. For example:

```kotlin
enum class MainNavigationContext(
    val title: String,
    val icon: ImageVector,
    override val initialDestination: Destination
) : NavigationContext<Destination> {

    HOME(title = "Home", icon = Icons.Default.Home, initialDestination = Destination.HOME),

    SETTINGS(title = "Settings", icon = Icons.Default.Settings, initialDestination = Destination.SETTINGS)
}
```

Then to change the current context, use the `Navigator.changeContext` function:

```kotlin
navigator.changeContext(MainNavigationContext.SETTINGS)
```

#### Transitions and animations

You have complete control over the composables that render the UI of the application and can use the Jetpack Compose
library's transition and animation APIs to change between the navigation context and destination UIs. For more
fine-grained control, create a custom composable replacing the `NavContainer` that handles transitions properly for your
application. Then just listen and react to the `Navigator.state` changes.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun <Destination : NavigationDestination, Context : NavigationContext<Destination>> MyNavContainer(
    navigator: Navigator<Destination, Context>,
) {
    val context = navigator.state.currentContextAsState()
    val destination = navigator.state.currentDestinationAsState()

    // Render UI from context and destination values and apply any transition or animtation desired.
}
```
